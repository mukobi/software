SUMMARY:Dreams as Allies: Embodiment, Poetry and Breakthrough
DESCRIPTION:Learn to Speak the Language of Your Dreams  When you learn how to understand your dreams\, they become one of your most important allies.    Every character and symbol in your dream is delivering a perspective on an experience you are having right now\, an old pattern that has been activated\, or a personal potential just waiting to unfold. One of the best ways to receive wisdom from our dreams is to relax into the language of the imagination.    Using embodiment\, poetry and active imagination\, today\, you will lend your dream characters your voice.  In return\, these characters\, animals and landscapes will help you make meaning of current and past events in your life\, inform the decisions you are making now\, and  understand the conflicts\, obstacles and opportunities currently on your path.    You will be surprised by how intuitive this work is.
