SUMMARY:The Role of Dreams in Grief & Bereavement
DESCRIPTION:After the death of a loved one\, we search for them everywhere. The place we finally find them is in our dreams.    We are each destined to be deeply bereaved in our lifetimes. Often\, this comes with overwhelming and complex emotions. Whatever our losses\, deep grief can be a turning point in our lives; a place we either become stuck\, or we transform.    More than in any other transition\, I rely on dreams when working with grief. In my experience\, dreams show us where we are stuck in our grieving process. Often\, something is communicated that helps us to open our hearts\, and keep going.    Today\, you will discover how your dreams are pointing to your unfinished business\, your unspoken emotions\, and the places where your grief remains hidden and unmoving.    TheseÂ dreams need your attention. And in return\, they offer you healing.    For the professional audience\, this workshop is invaluable for working with the dreams of your grieving and bereaved clients.    Early Bird Price: $120 before Sept 30
