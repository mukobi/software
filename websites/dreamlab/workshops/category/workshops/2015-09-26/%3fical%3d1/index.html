Past Testimonials  “The [Professional] Dream Training Day was amazing… The best part of the day was the way you facilitated each participant to be able to help others during the workshop and then integrating it into our own practice. Thank you Ilana for the very important dream work that you are doing in helping professionals help their clients.”      “As a therapist and on a personal level my recent two day participation into understanding dreams has opened up a wonderful world for self discovery and a new direction for working with my own clients. Ilana Laps and Chris Caldwell are wise and skilled facilitators. I felt safe in their expert hands… Dreams were opened up revealing such powerful and at times subtle meanings. I was left with a profound wish and commitment to explore this area of my life that I have paid such little attention to.” ~ Tony
